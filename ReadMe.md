# Welcome one an all to some random shit I built

## Outline

The aim of this task is to fuck around with matrices and code. One thing
we can use to look at this is building a game of tic tac toe

### Componets:

The components of this project consist of a live not so live server, a website
with different variations of the game built using different methods, and lastly
this read me file to guide viewers as to how this entire program works

### Info:

I have set the project to hold both my live server for those who wanna read 
my code and a live version deployed on github. The github deployement must be
incase I forget to do so in future.

I started of with a simple design using deconstructed methods to import my
