# Welcome one an all to some random shit I built

## Outline

The aim of this task is to fuck around with matrices and code. One thing
we can use to look at this is building a game of tic tac toe

### Componets:

The components of this project consist of a live not so live server, a website
with different variations of the game built using different methods, and lastly
this read me file to guide viewers as to how this entire program works

### Info:

I have set the project to hold both my live server for those who wanna read 
my code and a live version deployed on github. The github deployement must be
incase I forget to do so in future.


# Here We go

## The Server

I started of with a simple design using deconstructed methods to import my 
necessary components. For the live server I had to figure out how to add an 
automatic refresh. For the purpose of practicing I started building with concepts
I know and understand

#### `Error 1: `

Freaking favicon.ico. Is something that has become a thorn in my side. So for 
some weird reason using createReadStream method looks for favicon.ico, which 
ofcourse doesn't exist in my project so. Simply route I am just gonna add it

### Hold
I'm puting the creation of a reloading live server on hold for now.

## The site
Plain and simple html, css, javascript the only reason I added node was for my own development.


# `Note to self`
## Continue updates on this project
* Check more icons on google fonts
* Check server refresh packages
* Add package.json
* Look into creating gitignore
* Look at github pages and changing source file to public for launching
* Please you ass read the read me before you just continue the project
